This document explains in part what this project entails and the brief explanation of
how it would look, from the back that is.

Database
Users Table

id -------------------- This would be the users unique ID.
First Name ------------ This doesn't need to be unique.
Last Name ------------- Also doesn't need to be unique, but very essential.
Email ----------------- Definitely unique and essential.
Password -------------- User password - No useless password rules here just one
                        simple rule - Use a phrase, not a word
Signature ------------- This is one of the most-important parts:
                        It specifies how the users emails are perceived on the
                        receiving end and once the other user views the mail,
                        it verifies if the signature matches a present Signature
                        Signatures are auto-generated hashes that links each
                        account with another account. Your signature can be
                        altered and refreshed throughout the database, once in a
                        month and only when compromise is detected.


Emails Table

Senders ID ----------- The ID of the Sender
Receivers ID --------- The ID of the Receiver
Senders Signature ---- Signature of the Sender
Receivers Signature -- Signature of the Receiver; Left blank if this is the
                        first email being sent - Defaults to (0x16) represent.
Email Heading -------- Normal email header (text)
Email Subject -------- Email Subject (text)
Email Body ----------- Email Body (text)


Email Attachments --- For now, we wouldn't build this to support attachments for
                      specific reasons, Может быт поже!


Other attributes would be added to the project as time progresses.
